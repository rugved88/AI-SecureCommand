# AI-SecureCommand

# ü§ñ Secure Robotic Control System üõ°Ô∏è

This project showcases a robust communication protocol between a robotic controller and a robot, utilizing advanced AI models for real-time threat detection alongside state-of-the-art cryptographic measures to secure command transmissions. The system is designed to operate over UDP, fortified by dynamic AES-256 key encryption and RSA-2048 key exchanges to tackle the complexities of real-world network conditions.

## üöÄ Project Components

- `bot.py`: Simulates the robot's actions within a Pygame-based environment, adhering to directional commands from the controller.
- `attacker.py`: Engages in various network attack simulations to evaluate the system's resilience.
- `controller.py`: Manages operational commands to the robot, ensuring all communication is secured through robust cryptographic protocols.
- `classifier.ipynb`: Features LSTM and GRU models for detecting and classifying network attacks in real time.
- `bot_security.py` & `controller_security.py`: Implement the cryptographic mechanisms for secure command execution and key management, respectively.

## üìä Model Architecture and Training

- **Layers**: Utilizes an LSTM architecture with multiple layers, including 256-unit layers that return sequences, and a 512-unit layer for deeper analysis.
- **Activation**: Employs 'relu' for intermediate layers and 'softmax' for the output layer to categorize network attacks.
- **Training Strategy**: Incorporates early stopping and model checkpoints to optimize learning without overfitting, demonstrating high accuracy across 100 epochs.

## üéÆ Game Simulation

- **Environment**: Developed using Python and Pygame, this module creates a dynamic interaction scenario where a controller (via joystick) sends commands to navigate a robot through a virtual space.
- **Challenges**: The game is designed to mimic real-world operations where the robot must reach its destination efficiently while contending with continuous network-based attacks aiming to disrupt communication.

## üîí Security Features

- **Dynamic Key Encryption**: Implements AES-256 for command encryption and RSA-2048 for secure key exchanges.
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Utilizes LSTM and GRU models to dynamically detect and respond to cyber threats.
- **Secure Command Transmission**: Ensures all commands are encrypted using AES-256 and transmitted over UDP with additional application-layer encryption for enhanced security.

## üîÑ Regular Security Updates

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated AI systems continuously scan UDP traffic to detect and alert on potential threats.
- **Key Management**: Dynamic regeneration of AES-256 keys post-threat detection ensures ongoing protection, complemented by secure key transmissions via advanced RSA-2048 encrypted UDP channels.
- **System Integrity**: Regular updates to encryption keys and security protocols help address evolving threats and maintain high security standards.

## üåê Future Work

- **AI Enhancements**: Plan to integrate more sophisticated AI models for improved threat detection accuracy.
- **Cryptographic Advances**: Explore the incorporation of newer cryptographic algorithms to further strengthen security measures.
- **Simulation Expansion**: Develop a more interactive and challenging simulation environment to rigorously test the system under diverse conditions.
